When the user signs out
  - the handleSignOut method triggers
    - removes token from localstorage
    - set a value of this.state.user to null.
  - Navbar class indicates that the value of user has changed
    - links back to sign-in/sign-up page.
  - Because the value of user became null, the user has no longer access to logged in page unless they sign-in and get the value of user and token again.
  - Also, since the token is removed from the localshotrage, refreshing the page would also do nothing about getting data back.
  - user's data is saved in database, so they can sign in to get back to GIF page.
