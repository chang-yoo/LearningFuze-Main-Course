Once signed in
  - The handleSignIn saves the token in localstorage
    - when refreshing the app, the server pulls token from localstorage and verify if the value is constant by jwtDecode() function
    - if value is constant, user can stay signed in after refreshing and gives back boolean false to isAuthorizing property
    - render method check if isAuthorizing is true -> return null, otherwise return to page
